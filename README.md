# EEG
For our PWS (School Research Project) at Christelijk Gymnasium Utrecht, we have built an EEG (electroencephalogram) machine. This is a machine that measures brain waves,  voltage differences which oscillate and represent synchronized activity over a network of neurons. For our project, we measure alpha waves originating from the occipital lobe because they are one of the strongest EEG signals. Alpha waves reflect activities in the visual cortex, when someone closes their eyes or relaxes, their magnitude is increased, and decreased with open eyes and concentration.

## We have used the EEG data for multiple applications:
- [Analyzing the data.](analysis)
- [Playing flappy bird by blinking.](flappy)
- [Predicting whether people have their eyes open or closed (our data and data from others as they measured multiple channels).](prediction)
